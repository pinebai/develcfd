Parser for XML-files in Fortran:
--------------------------------

CONTENTS

The directory structure is straightforward:

README
   This file
CHANGES
   Version and release information
doc/
   Contains the relevant documents describing how to use the parser module
   and the xmlreader utility that can generate the source of a module
   to read XML files with a particular structure.
src/
   Contains the sources and a simple makefile for creating the library
   and test programs. Also contains the source for the xmlreader
   utility that
examples/
   Contains example programs and input files
lib/
   After installation, contains the library and the module file, so
   that other programs can use it


INSTALLATION

This depends on the compiler you use and the platform, but the following
steps are required:

1. Make the library and the module file via the makefile or something
   equivalent:

   > make

2. Copy the library and the module file to a place where the compiler
   will be able to find them. Within the limits of the simple makefile
   that is delivered here, this should do the trick:

   > make install

Notes:
Compilers vary in the naming convention for the module files. It is
virtually impossible to support them all, so the makefile supports
only a few of the possibilities.
