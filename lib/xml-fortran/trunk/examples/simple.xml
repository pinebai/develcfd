    <title>Plotting a Simple Graph</title>

    <para>
      We shall first consider plotting simple graphs showing the dependence
      of one variable upon another.  Such a graph may be composed of
      several elements:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A box which defines the ranges of the variables, perhaps with
	  axes and numeric labels along its edges.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A set of points or lines within the box showing the functional
	  dependence.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A set of labels for the variables and a title for the graph.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      In order to draw such a graph, it is necessary to call at least four
      of the PLplot functions:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  &#38;plinit;, to initialize PLplot.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  &#38;plenv;, to define the range and scale of the
	  graph, and draw labels, axes, etc.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  One or more calls to &#38;plline; or &#38;plpoin; to draw lines or points
	  as needed.  Other more complex routines include &#38;plbin; and
	  &#38;plhist; to draw histograms, &#38;plerrx; and &#38;plerry; to draw
	  error-bars.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  &#38;plend;, to close the plot.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      More than one graph can be drawn on a single set of axes by making
      repeated calls to the routines listed in item 3 above.  PLplot only
      needs to be initialized once unless plotting to multiple output
      devices.
